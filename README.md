# Cracking XORSHIFT128
This repo recreates the original article and paper on cracking the xorshift128 algorithm through machine learning.
There are 3 files. The original code in Tensorflow, an alternative in Pytorch and finally pytorch with a new data sample to prove its generalizability.  
Note: the original paper has some errors in the way they transform the numbers into bit arrays that are corrected in these versions.
